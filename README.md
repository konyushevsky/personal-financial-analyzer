# personal-financial-analyzer
The "personal-finance-analyzer" app (hereinafter referred to as PFA) is built on the simple idea of ​​displaying the difference between the user's income and expenses as a balance. We have three main sections: 
1) In the "balance" section, we see the total balance, as well as the balance we can spend exclusively today and the balance we can spend tomorrow (depending on the total balance at the time of use, the desired amount we want to accumulate over a given period, and the number of incomes, again, falling within the period).
2) In turn, in the "expenses" section, we see the amount of expenses for the period, which we divide into two parts: the first part is the expenses we enter in advance. This is necessary to avoid strong volatility: imagine a situation where you took the sum of your money and simply divided it by days, and it seemed to give you how much you need to spend per day. But this is deceptive! On any given day, you may need to pay an amount—for example, for apartment rent—that exceeds the daily rate. This will cause subsequent expenses to be recalculated for the remaining days of the period, potentially even to zero. Therefore, a separate entry is made for a portion of the total expenses as a preliminary section—usually these are fixed expenses. We are left with a portion of the total expenses with progressive daily expense entries—usually these are variable expenses. This is also divided into two subsections: the total amount of progressive daily expenses and the amount of progressive daily expenses within the current day, which resets to zero each day, allowing for the entry of new progressive expenses for the new day.
3) And the third section is receipts: everything is simple here: simply enter the funds have received and/or due for the period. The maximum planning horizon (period in days) must be within the limits of the funds already available! Otherwise, the daily rate will be calculated incorrectly due to potentially different intervals of cash receipts within the period, as well as the time of receipt within the day.

Additionally, there's an initialization section where you enter a period in days, a target amount, or a daily spending amount, depending on the strategy selected here. This determines whether you'll see your savings grow gradually or see it immediately as a target. There's also a reset button for resetting all values ​​to their initial values, and a start button that initiates a progressive switch of days within the period. Finally, there's a field displaying the current day and a field for entering the period in days.

The application will initially be created without registration and as a rich client with a client-side database. It will be as simple as possible, without modal windows, with basic input and output, displaying only the most basic metrics that can be understood at a glance.
